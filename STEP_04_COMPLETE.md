# Step 04: Sample Reception - ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fully Implemented & Tested  
**Test Results**: All tests passing (100%)

## üìã Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the complete sample reception workflow as specified in `step-04-sample-reception.md`. The system now provides laboratory staff with powerful tools to receive physical samples, match them with digital protocols, assign final protocol numbers, and generate printable labels.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features Implemented

### üî¢ Protocol Numbering System
- **ProtocolCounter model** for sequential numbering per type and year
- **Atomic number generation** with database-level locking to prevent duplicates
- **Automatic year rollover** (resets on January 1st)
- **Format**: `CT 24/001` (Cytology) or `HP 24/123` (Histopathology)
- **Separate counters** for each analysis type

### üîç Sample Reception Interface
- **Search by temporary code** - Quick lookup for incoming samples
- **Protocol verification display** - Shows all relevant information before reception
- **Reception confirmation form** with:
  - Sample condition assessment (√ìptima, Aceptable, Sub√≥ptima, Rechazada)
  - Quantity verification (slides/jars received vs expected)
  - Reception notes
  - Discrepancy reporting
