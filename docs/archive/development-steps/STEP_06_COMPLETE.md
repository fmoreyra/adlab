   - Add observations and diagnosis
   - Save as draft
   
3. **Edit Report**: Add cassette-specific observations
   - Multiple observations per cassette
   - Partial diagnosis per cassette
   - Save changes anytime

## Next Steps

The report generation system is fully functional and ready for use. Recommended next steps:

1. **Step 07: Work Order Management** - Generate work orders alongside reports
2. **Step 08: Email Notifications** - Enhanced notification system
3. **Step 09: Dashboard** - Analytics and metrics
4. **User Training**: Train histopathologists on the new system
5. **Template Customization**: Adjust PDF template to match institutional branding
6. **Signature Upload**: Have histopathologists upload their digital signatures

## Notes

- All user-facing text is in Spanish
- PDF generation uses ReportLab (already installed in Step 04)
- Email sending uses Django's built-in email system
- Digital signatures are optional but recommended for official reports
- Reports can be revised by creating new versions
- Email delivery failures are logged for follow-up
