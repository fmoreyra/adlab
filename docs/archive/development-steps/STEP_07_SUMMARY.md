# Step 07: Work Order Management - Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Tests**: 27/27 passing ✅

## What Was Implemented

Step 07 adds comprehensive work order (Orden de Trabajo/OT) management to the laboratory system for billing and invoicing laboratory services.

### Core Features

✅ **Pricing Catalog System**: Manage service prices with validity periods  
✅ **Sequential OT Numbering**: Automatic OT-YYYY-NNN format (e.g., OT-2024-001)  
✅ **Work Order Creation**: Create OTs for completed protocols  
✅ **Protocol Grouping**: Group multiple protocols from same veterinarian  
✅ **Financial Tracking**: Advance payments, balance calculation  
✅ **Payment Status**: Pending/Partial/Paid tracking  
✅ **Status Workflow**: Draft → Issued → Sent → Invoiced  
✅ **PDF Generation**: Professional PDFs with ReportLab  
✅ **Admin Interface**: Full CRUD operations  
✅ **Comprehensive Tests**: 27 passing tests  

### Technical Implementation

**Models** (4 new models):
- `PricingCatalog`: Service pricing with validity dates
- `WorkOrderCounter`: Year-based sequential numbering
- `WorkOrder`: Main OT model with financial tracking
- `WorkOrderService`: Line items linking protocols to OT

**Views** (7 views):
- List, filter, and search work orders
- View pending protocols grouped by veterinarian
- Select protocols for grouping
- Create work order with automatic pricing
- View work order details
- Issue, send, and track status
- Generate and serve PDF

**Forms** (6 forms):
- Protocol selection with validation
- Work order creation with billing details
- Pricing catalog management
- Search and filter forms

**Templates** (5 HTML templates):
- List view with filtering
- Pending protocols by veterinarian
- Protocol selection interface
- Work order creation form
- Detailed work order view

**Admin** (4 admin panels):
- Pricing catalog with validity indicators
- Work order counter management
- Work order with inline services
- Service line items

### Code Quality

✅ Follows cursor rules strictly  
✅ Early returns pattern  
✅ Helper functions for complex logic  
✅ English model names, Spanish UI  
✅ Comprehensive docstrings  
✅ PEP 8 compliant  
✅ 27 passing tests

### Database Changes

Migration `0008_workorder_management` successfully applied:
- Dropped old placeholder WorkOrder table
- Created 4 new tables with proper relationships
- Added 8 indexes for query optimization

### Business Logic

- **Automatic Pricing**: Looks up current prices from catalog
- **Grouping Rules**: Same veterinarian, ready status, no existing OT
- **Sequential Numbering**: Thread-safe with database transactions
- **Payment Calculation**: Automatic balance = total - advance
- **Status Transitions**: Enforced workflow with validation
- **PDF Generation**: Professional format with itemized services

### Default Pricing

Per requirements:
- Histopathology (2-5 pieces): $14.04 USD
- Cytology: $5.40 USD

Can be managed through admin panel.

### Testing

**27 tests covering**:
- Pricing catalog (5 tests)
- Work order counter (4 tests)
- Work order model (11 tests)
- Service model (3 tests)
- Integration workflow (4 tests)

**Test Results**: ✅ 27/27 passing (0 failures, 0 errors)
