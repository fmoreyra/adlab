# Laboratory System - Project Status

**Last Updated:** October 12, 2025

## Implementation Status Overview

### ‚úÖ Completed Steps

- **Step 01**: Authentication & Authorization - COMPLETE
- **Step 01.1**: Email Verification - COMPLETE
- **Step 02**: Veterinarian Profiles - COMPLETE
- **Step 03**: Protocol Submission - COMPLETE
- **Step 04**: Sample Reception - COMPLETE
- **Step 05**: Sample Processing - COMPLETE
- **Step 06**: Report Generation - COMPLETE
- **Step 07**: Work Orders (OT) - COMPLETE
- **Step 14**: Storage & Backup Configuration - DOCUMENTED

### üìã Planned Steps (Ready for Implementation)

- **Step 08**: Email Notifications
- **Step 09**: Dashboard & Monitoring
- **Step 10**: Reports & Analytics (Refined with Celery approach)
- **Step 12**: System Administration
- **Step 13**: Email Configuration
- **Step 15**: User Dashboards & Feature Discovery

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Deferred Steps

- **Step 11**: Data Migration
  - **Status**: DEFERRED / Not to be implemented
  - **Reason**: Unclear requirements for legacy system data usage
  - **Alternative**: Manual SQL insert for critical records if needed
  - **Future**: Can be revisited if clear business need emerges
  - **Effort Saved**: ~3 weeks

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Core System)
1. Step 08: Email Notifications
2. Step 09: Dashboard & Monitoring

### Medium Priority (Analytics & Admin)
3. Step 10: Reports & Analytics
4. Step 12: System Administration
5. Step 15: User Dashboards & Feature Discovery

### Low Priority (Configuration)
6. Step 13: Email Configuration (may already be covered)

## Step 10 Refinement Notes

Step 10 (Reports & Analytics) has been refined:
- Web pages only (no CSV/Excel/PDF exports)
- Daily Celery calculations (2 AM)
- Print-friendly design
- Admin-only access
- Reduced effort: 4-5 days (down from 7 days)

See `steps/STEP_10_REFINEMENT.md` for full details.

## Step 11 Deferral Notes

Step 11 (Data Migration) has been deferred:
- Legacy Clarion system data migration not required initially
- New system will start with fresh data
- Manual SQL inserts available for critical historical records
- 3 weeks of effort saved

See warning section in `steps/step-11-data-migration.md` for full details.

## Project Completion Estimate

### Completed Work
- **7 major steps** completed
- Core functionality operational
- Work orders implemented
- Basic system ready for use

### Remaining Work
- **5-6 steps** to complete (depending on Step 13 overlap)
- **Estimated Time**: 3-4 weeks
  - Step 08: 3-4 days
  - Step 09: 4-5 days
  - Step 10: 4-5 days
  - Step 12: 3-4 days
  - Step 15: 5 days
  - Step 13: 1-2 days (if needed)

### Time Saved by Refinements
- Step 10 refinement: ~2-3 days saved
- Step 11 deferral: ~3 weeks saved

## Next Recommended Step

**Step 08: Email Notifications**
- Critical for user communication
- Builds on existing Celery setup
- Integrates with completed steps (protocols, reports, work orders)
- Estimated: 3-4 days

## Notes

- All completed steps have comprehensive tests
- Code follows `.cursorrules` standards
- Documentation maintained for each step
- System is functional and can be deployed in current state
