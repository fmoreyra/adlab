# Archive Documentation

**Important**: This is NOT just "old" documentation—it's a critical **implementation log** of how the application was built incrementally!

## 📦 What's Archived Here

This directory preserves the **incremental development history** of the laboratory system. These documents chronicle the step-by-step implementation process and are essential for understanding:

- **How features were built** incrementally
- **Which steps have been completed** (have `STEP_XX_COMPLETE.md` files)
- **Which steps are future work** (missing `STEP_XX_COMPLETE.md` indicates unresolved/future work)
- **Design decisions made during implementation**
- **The evolution of the codebase**

## 📁 Contents

### [Development Steps](./development-steps/) ⭐ IMPLEMENTATION LOG

**Critical**: These `STEP_*_COMPLETE.md` files are **implementation logs**, not historical artifacts!

**What they contain**:
- Detailed record of incremental feature implementation
- Code changes made in each development step
- Testing procedures and results
- Integration challenges and solutions
- Implementation timeline and sequence

**How to interpret**:
- ✅ **File exists** (e.g., `STEP_03_COMPLETE.md`) = Feature implemented and documented
- ❌ **File missing** (e.g., no `STEP_09_COMPLETE.md`) = Unresolved step or future work
- 📋 **Planning file exists** (in `planning/steps/`) = Spec'd but not yet implemented

**Critical use cases**:
- Understanding how features were built incrementally
- Identifying which planned features are not yet implemented
- Troubleshooting by reviewing implementation details
- Continuing development following the established pattern

### [Planning Documentation](./planning/)
Original project planning materials (main-project-docs/ folder).

**Contains**:
- Software development plan
- Feature specifications
- Architecture decisions
- Tech stack evaluation
- Future roadmap

**Use case**: Understanding project scope, reviewing planned vs. implemented features

## 📊 Implementation Status Tracking

### Completed Steps (Have STEP_*_COMPLETE.md)

The following steps have been **implemented and documented**:

| Step | Feature | Status | Documentation |
|------|---------|--------|---------------|
| 01 | Authentication System | ✅ Complete | `STEP_01_COMPLETE.md` |
| 01.1 | Email Verification | ✅ Complete | `STEP_01.1_COMPLETE.md` |
| 02 | Veterinarian Profiles | ✅ Complete | `STEP_02_COMPLETE.md` |
| 03 | Protocol Submission | ✅ Complete | `STEP_03_COMPLETE.md` |
| 04 | Sample Reception | ✅ Complete | `STEP_04_COMPLETE.md` |
| 05 | Sample Processing | ✅ Complete | `STEP_05_COMPLETE.md` |
| 06 | Report Generation | ✅ Complete | `STEP_06_COMPLETE.md` |
| 07 | Work Orders | ✅ Complete | `STEP_07_COMPLETE.md` + `STEP_07_SUMMARY.md` |
| 08 | Email Notifications | ✅ Complete | `STEP_08_COMPLETE.md` + 3 supporting docs |
| 15 | User Dashboards | ✅ Complete | `STEP_15_COMPLETE.md` |

### Planned But Not Yet Implemented (Missing STEP_*_COMPLETE.md)

These steps have **planning documentation** but **no implementation log**, indicating future work:

| Step | Feature | Status | Planning Doc |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|
| 09 | Dashboard (Basic) | ⏳ Planned | `planning/steps/step-09-dashboard.md` |
| 10 | Reports & Analytics | ⏳ Planned | `planning/steps/step-10-reports-analytics.md` |
| 11 | Data Migration | ⏳ Planned | `planning/steps/step-11-data-migration.md` |
| 12 | System Admin | ⏳ Planned | `planning/steps/step-12-system-admin.md` |
| 13 | Email Configuration | ⏳ Planned | `planning/steps/step-13-email-configuration.md` |
| 14 | Storage & Backup | ⏳ Planned | `planning/steps/step-14-storage-backup.md` |
| 16 | Testing Coverage | ⏳ Planned | `planning/steps/step-16-testing-coverage-plan.md` |
| 17 | Async Performance | ⏳ Planned | `planning/steps/step-17-async-performance-optimization.md` |
| 18 | Monitoring Metrics | ⏳ Planned | `planning/steps/step-18-monitoring-metrics.md` |
| 19 | Domain Documentation | ⏳ Planned | `planning/steps/step-19-domain-documentation.md` |
| 20 | Multi-tenant SaaS | ⏳ Planned | `planning/steps/step-20-multi-tenant-saas-refactoring.md` |

**Key insight**: Steps 09-20 (except 15) have specifications but no `STEP_XX_COMPLETE.md` files, meaning they represent future development work or features that were partially implemented without formal documentation.

### How to Use This Information

**For new features:**
1. Check if a planning doc exists in `planning/steps/`
2. Check if a `STEP_XX_COMPLETE.md` exists
3. If only planning exists → Feature is designed but not implemented
4. If both exist → Feature is fully implemented, review implementation log

**For understanding the codebase:**
1. Start with `STEP_01_COMPLETE.md` and read sequentially
2. Each STEP builds on previous steps
3. Implementation logs show actual code changes made
4. Missing STEPs indicate gaps in incremental documentation (feature may exist, just undocumented)

## 📝 Using Archived Documentation

### When to Reference Archives

**Development Steps** (IMPLEMENTATION LOGS): When you need to:
- **Understand how features were built** incrementally
- **Identify which features are complete** vs. planned
- **Review implementation decisions** and rationale
- **Continue incremental development** following the established pattern
- **Debug issues** by understanding original implementation
- **Onboard new developers** to the development methodology

**Planning Docs**: When you need to:
- **Review original requirements** for a feature
- **Compare planned vs. actual implementation** (what changed and why)
- **Understand project roadmap** and feature priorities
- **Plan future work** on unimplemented features (Steps 09-14, 16-20)

### When NOT to Use Archives

❌ For operational procedures → Use [Operations](../operations/)
❌ For deployment instructions → Use [Deployment](../deployment/)
❌ For configuration → Use [Configuration](../configuration/)
❌ For current development → Use [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)

## 🗂️ Archive Organization Principle

Archives are organized **chronologically by development phase**, not by topic. This preserves the **incremental development narrative** and shows how the application was built step-by-step.

### Incremental Development Methodology

This project was built following an **incremental, iterative approach**:

1. **Planning Phase**: Feature specifications created in `planning/steps/step-XX-*.md`
2. **Implementation Phase**: Features built incrementally, following the step sequence
3. **Documentation Phase**: Implementation logged in `development-steps/STEP_XX_COMPLETE.md`

**Why this matters:**
- Each step builds on previous steps (dependencies)
- Implementation order matters for understanding the codebase
- Missing STEP_XX_COMPLETE.md files indicate incomplete work or future features
- Reading steps sequentially shows the evolution of the system

**Example**: To understand Protocol Management:
1. Start with STEP_03 (Protocol Submission)
2. Continue with STEP_04 (Sample Reception)
3. Then STEP_05 (Sample Processing)
4. Then STEP_06 (Report Generation)
5. Finally STEP_07 (Work Orders)

This shows how protocols flow through the entire system.

## 💡 Tips for Searching Archives

1. **Use grep**: `grep -r "Protocol" development-steps/` to find all mentions
2. **Check CHANGES.md**: Quick summary of what happened when
3. **Start with planning**: Review specs before implementation details
4. **Follow the numbers**: STEP files are in chronological order
