## 🔒 Security & Access Control

### Role-Based Access
- ✅ `@login_required` decorator on all dashboard views
- ✅ Permission checks with early returns
- ✅ Redirect to appropriate dashboard on unauthorized access
- ✅ User role properties from User model:
  - `is_veterinarian`
  - `is_lab_staff`
  - `is_histopathologist`
  - `is_admin_user`

### Data Privacy
- ✅ Veterinarians only see their own protocols and reports
- ✅ Lab staff see all protocols for processing
- ✅ Histopathologists see all pending reports
- ✅ Admins see system-wide statistics

---

## 📊 Statistics & Metrics

### Database Queries Optimized

All dashboard views use:
- **select_related()** for foreign key lookups
- **Date filtering** for current month/year statistics
- **Count aggregation** for efficient counting
- **Query limiting** ([:10], [:100]) to prevent performance issues

### Performance Considerations

- Statistics calculated on-the-fly (real-time data)
- Limited result sets for recent activity
- Efficient date comparisons using Django ORM
- Minimal template logic for fast rendering
