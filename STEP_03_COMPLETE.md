   - `CytologySample`: Cytology-specific sample information
   - `HistopathologySample`: Histopathology-specific sample information
   - `ProtocolStatusHistory`: Audit trail for protocol status changes
   - `WorkOrder`: Placeholder model for future implementation (Step 07)

2. **Forms**
   - `CytologyProtocolForm`: Combined form for creating cytology protocols with sample data
   - `HistopathologyProtocolForm`: Combined form for creating histopathology protocols with sample data

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Temporary Code Generation
- Format: `TMP-{TYPE}-{YYYYMMDD}-{ID}`
- Examples: `TMP-CT-20241010-001`, `TMP-HP-20241010-002`
- Unique per protocol
- Generated upon submission (not for drafts)

### 2. Protocol Numbering System
- Format: `{TYPE} {YY}/{NRO}`
- Examples: `CT 24/001` (first cytology of 2024), `HP 24/123` (123rd histopathology of 2024)
- Sequential numbering per year and type
- Assigned when sample is received
- Numbering resets each year

### 3. Protocol Status Workflow
- **Draft**: Can be edited/deleted by veterinarian
- **Submitted**: Locked for editing, temporary code assigned, awaiting reception
- **Received**: Sample received, protocol number assigned
- **Processing**: Sample in processing stages
- **Ready**: Analysis complete, ready for report
- **Report Sent**: Final report sent to veterinarian

### 4. Animal/Patient Data Storage
- No separate animal entity (per design decision IV.3.3)
- All patient data stored directly in Protocol model
- Supports multiple samples from same animal (each gets unique protocol)

### 5. Access Control
- Veterinarians can only view/edit their own protocols
- Lab staff has full access through admin interface
- Draft protocols are editable/deletable only by owner
- Submitted protocols are locked from veterinarian editing

### 6. Protocol Filtering
- Filter by status (draft, submitted, received, processing, ready, report_sent)
- Filter by analysis type (cytology, histopathology)
- Filter by date range (submission date)
- Search by animal ID, protocol code, or diagnosis
- Pagination support (20 protocols per page)

### 7. Status Timeline
- Complete audit trail of status changes
- Records who changed status and when
- Optional description for each change
- Displayed chronologically in protocol detail view

### 8. Form Validation
**Cytology Required Fields:**
- Species, Animal Identification
- Presumptive Diagnosis
- Technique Used, Sampling Site
- Number of Slides
- Submission Date

**Histopathology Required Fields:**
- Species, Animal Identification
- Presumptive Diagnosis
- Material Submitted
- Number of Containers
- Submission Date

## Design Decisions

### 1. Embedded Animal Data
- **Decision**: Store animal/patient data directly in Protocol model
- **Rationale**: Per design decision IV.3.3, no separate animal entity
- **Benefit**: Simplifies data model, no need to manage separate animal records
- **Trade-off**: Cannot track multiple protocols for same animal directly

### 2. One-to-One Sample Relationship
- **Decision**: Each protocol has exactly one sample (either cytology or histopathology)
- **Rationale**: Each sample gets its own protocol per requirements
- **Implementation**: OneToOneField from sample models to Protocol

### 3. Temporary Code vs Protocol Number
- **Decision**: Two-stage identification system
- **Temporary Code**: Pre-reception tracking (format: TMP-CT-20241010-001)
- **Protocol Number**: Post-reception final number (format: CT 24/001)
- **Rationale**: Allows veterinarians to track samples before lab receives them

### 4. Status-Based Access Control
- **Decision**: Draft protocols are editable/deletable, submitted+ are locked
- **Rationale**: Maintain data integrity once protocol is submitted
- **Benefit**: Prevents accidental changes to protocols already in processing

### 5. Combined Forms
- **Decision**: Single form combines Protocol + Sample data
- **Rationale**: Better UX - veterinarian fills one form, not two
- **Implementation**: Custom form classes that save both models atomically

### 6. English Model Names
- **Decision**: Use English for all model and field names
- **Rationale**: As requested by user for consistency and maintainability
- **Example**: `Protocol`, `CytologySample`, `HistopathologySample`

## Usage Examples

### 1. Create Cytology Protocol
```python
# Veterinarian navigates to /protocols/select-type/
# Selects "Cytology"
# Fills form with:
- Species: Canino
- Animal ID: Max
- Diagnosis: Suspected lymphoma
- Technique: PAAF
- Sampling site: Left submandibular lymph node
- Number of slides: 2

# System creates Protocol and CytologySample
# Status: DRAFT
# Can edit or delete before submission
```

### 2. Submit Protocol
```python
# Veterinarian clicks "Submit Protocol" on detail page
# System:
  - Changes status to SUBMITTED
  - Generates temporary code: TMP-CT-20241010-001
  - Logs status change
  - Shows success message with code
  - Locks protocol from further editing
```

### 3. Receive Sample (Lab Staff)
```python
# Lab staff opens protocol in admin
# Clicks "Mark as received" action
# System:
  - Changes status to RECEIVED
  - Assigns protocol number: CT 24/001
  - Sets reception_date to today
  - Logs status change
```

### 4. Filter Protocols
```python
# Veterinarian uses filters:
- Status: Submitted
- Type: Cytology
- Date range: Last 30 days
- Search: "Max"

# System returns matching protocols with pagination
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Test Discovery Note**: For best results, run tests explicitly: `python3 manage.py test accounts.tests protocols.tests` (all 108 tests pass ✅)

2. **No Auto-save**: Draft protocols don't auto-save. If veterinarian navigates away, changes are lost.

3. **No File Attachments**: Cannot attach images or documents to protocols yet (future feature).

4. **Single Sample Per Protocol**: Each protocol can have only one sample. Multiple samples require multiple protocols.

5. **No Protocol Linking**: Cannot reference related protocols (e.g., multiple samples from same animal).

## Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-save Functionality** (Step 03 technical consideration)
   - Auto-save drafts every N seconds
   - Local storage backup
   - Warning on navigate away

2. **File Attachments** (Step 03 technical consideration)
   - Clinical images
   - Pre-operative photos
   - Previous analysis results

3. **Species/Breed Lists** (Step 03 technical decision #1)
   - Currently: Free text entry
   - Future: Dropdown with "Other" option
   - Benefit: Better data consistency

4. **Protocol Linking** (Step 03 requirement)
   - Link related protocols
   - Track multiple samples from same animal
   - Show related protocols in detail view

5. **Email Notifications** (Step 08)
   - Notify veterinarian on status changes
   - Send temporary code confirmation
   - Protocol received notifications

6. **PDF Protocol Generation**
   - Print-friendly protocol format
   - Include temporary code as barcode
   - Attach to sample shipment
